The human audio signals you can run on the project have been subjected to FFT (Fast  Fourier Transform) analysis to explore its frequency components.
Bandpass filters have been designed and applied to facilitate the differentiation of male and female voices. These filters are tailored to selectively pass frequency bands associated with typical male and female voice ranges. The filtered signals  are then analyzed to compute their respective power levels, which serve as metrics 
for voice classification.

The file format must be .wav
